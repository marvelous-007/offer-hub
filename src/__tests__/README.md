## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all progressive image tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="progressive-image"

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="avatar"
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="portfolio"
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="message"

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- --testPathPatterns="progressive-image"
```

## Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. Basic Progressive Loading
- Image loads with blur placeholder
- Smooth transition to full image
- Loading spinner during load
- Error state for failed images

### 2. Avatar Integration
- User profile avatars with progressive loading
- Fallback handling for missing images
- Consistent sizing and styling
- Custom blur data URL support

### 3. Portfolio Gallery
- Project image galleries with progressive loading
- Navigation between projects
- Pagination with image loading
- Mixed success/failure scenarios

### 4. Messaging System
- Chat image attachments with progressive loading
- File upload previews
- Multiple image handling
- Mixed attachment types

### 5. Performance Scenarios
- Rapid image loading
- Network failure handling
- User interaction during loading
- Large image galleries

### 6. Error Handling
- Invalid image URLs
- Network timeouts
- Missing images
- Graceful degradation

## Mock Strategy

The tests use comprehensive mocking to simulate real-world scenarios:

- **ProgressiveImage Component**: Mocked with realistic loading behavior
- **Next.js Router**: Mocked for navigation testing
- **File APIs**: Mocked for file upload testing
- **Network Requests**: Simulated with delays and failures

## Assertions

Tests verify:
- ✅ Correct component rendering
- ✅ Proper prop passing
- ✅ Loading state transitions
- ✅ Error state handling
- ✅ User interaction responses
- ✅ Performance characteristics
- ✅ Accessibility features

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines and provide:
- Fast execution (< 30 seconds for full suite)
- Reliable results across environments
- Clear failure reporting
- Coverage metrics

## Future Enhancements

- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing
